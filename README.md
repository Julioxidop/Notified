# Notified
Notifications system to implement in servers

## How to use
### Server Operators
To send a new notification we need to use the next command:
```
/notification
```
It will pop up a window with 2 fields:
- The first one is the title of the new notification
- The second one is the message of the new notification

Then we just need to click "Send" 

### Server Players
To open the notifications window, just press N in the keyboard. This can be changed in the keybinds configuration.

## Customize and language
We can customize the textures of the windows, for it we can download from here the template to create the resourcepack.
In this same template comes the file en_us.json, we only need to create our own .json with the language we need.
