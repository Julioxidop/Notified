## How to use
### Server Operators
To send a new notification we need to use the next command:
```
/notification
```
This will pop up a window with 2 fields:
- The first one is the title of the new notification
- The second one is the message of the new notification

Then we just need to click "Send" button.

### Server Players
To open the notifications window, just press N in the keyboard. This can be changed in the keybinds configuration.

## Customize and language
We can customize the textures of the windows, for it we can download from [here](https://github.com/Julioxidop/Notified/releases/tag/NotifiedRP) the default files to modify them.
In this same .zip comes the file en_us.json, we only need to create our own .json with the language we need.
